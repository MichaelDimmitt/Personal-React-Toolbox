# Personal-React-Toolbox
Contains solutions to common problems, such as: 
1) debounce, 
2) throttling, 
3) network cancelation, 
4) helpers, 
5) proxy files for api interactions 
6) portable npm components that come with mini routers to tack into your project

... and other ideas.

Coming soon and just a personal reference for now, so no promise for support.

If there are sources I will include them in the files.
